/* *****************************************************************************
 Suppose that people enter a room one at a time. How people must enter until two share a birthday?
 Counterintuitively, after 23 people enter the room, there is approximately a 50â€“50 chance that two
 share a birthday. This phenomenon is known as the birthday problem or birthday paradox.
 Program Birthday.java that takes two integer command-line arguments n and trials and performs the
 following experiment, trials times.
